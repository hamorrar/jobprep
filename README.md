This is a collection of my notes on various books, articles, research papers, or videos I have looked into to prepare for interviews for jobs in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Distributed/Operating Systems. I will link resources whenever possible.

Current Goal: Ideally, a research based position in Machine Learning for Systems field.

Current Reading: [Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).
- Introduces various fundamentals of competitive programming in C++. Notes are in [CPHandbook](/CPHandbook). My intention of reading this book is to gain a foundational understanding of data sturctures and algorithms for Leetcode because I have been struggling with the Easy difficulty problems.
