# Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm makes a solution to the problem by always picking the best possible option at any given step. These algorithms do not take back their choices and are often very efficient.

## Example: Coin Problem
- The problem is to sum the given coins to a predetermined number ``n`` using as few coins as possible and coins can be reused.
- The algorithm is to always pick the largest coin possible until the desired sum is reached.
- This does not always produce an optimal solution.
