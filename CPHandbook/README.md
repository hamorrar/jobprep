# Competitive Programmer's Handbook
## By: Antti Laaksonen

A book that briefly covers introductory material for competitive programmers. A lot of the topics mentioned in the book are foundational for any computer scientist.

These notes do not cover the entire book and they are not exhaustive of the chapters that I did take notes on. I only took notes on what I thought is most important for foundational knowledge to get started with Leetcode problem solving.

I did not finish the book. Planning to go to something more directly related to DS&A from a more reputable source. I wasn't a big fan of how the handbook presents and explains things.
